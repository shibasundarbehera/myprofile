    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a hands-on engineering leader with over 15 years of experience in designing and delivering scalable, cloud-native SaaS platforms used by millions worldwide. Currently, I lead a global team of 20+ engineers at Ideagen, driving innovation and building resilient, multi-tenant applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      My expertise spans .NET Core, Node.js, React, Angular, Python, and Go, with deep experience in distributed systems, microservices, serverless architectures, and event-driven designs. I specialize in modernizing legacy applications into high-performance single-page applications while ensuring enterprise-grade security and compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leveraging containerization technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes, I have architected scalable infrastructures on AWS and hybrid cloud deployments using AWS. On the data side, I have designed solutions using SQL Server, MongoDB, OpenSearch, and vector databases to enable AI-driven, low-latency analytics and search capabilities.
